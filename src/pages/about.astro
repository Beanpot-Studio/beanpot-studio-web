        <p class="text-2xl">
        Welcome! I'm Jen Looper. I'm the founder and CEO of Beanpot
        Studio, where great things are cooking, built in Boston. I have
        over 25 years' experience as a web and mobile developer,
        specializing in creating creative cross-platform apps, often
        with an educational focus. I design excellent curricula on
        technical topics and am known for the quality of my
        educational content, my managerial skills, and my creative
        strategies.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl mt-5">
        I've worked as Head of Academic Advocacy at AWS, a Principal
        Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft, and as a Developer
        Advocate at Progress/Telerik. I've also worked at small,
        medium, and large companies over my career.
