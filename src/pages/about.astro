              Welcome! I'm Jen Looper. I'm the founder and CEO of Beanpot
              Studio, where great things are cooking, built in Boston. I have
              over 25 years' experience as a web and mobile developer,
              specializing in creating creative cross-platform apps, often
              with an educational focus. I design excellent curricula on
              technical topics and am known for the quality of my
              educational content, my managerial skills, and my creative
              strategies.
            </p>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-5">
              I've worked as Head of Academic Advocacy at AWS, a Principal
              Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft, and as a Developer
              Advocate at Progress/Telerik. I've also worked at small,
              medium, and large companies over my career.
