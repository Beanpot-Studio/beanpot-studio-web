              Welcome! I'm Jen Looper. I'm the founder and CEO of Beanpot
              Studio, where great things are cooking, built in Boston. I have
              over 25 years' experience as a web and mobile developer,
              specializing in creating creative cross-platform apps, often with
              an educational focus. I design excellent curricula on technical
              topics and am known for the quality of my educational content, my
              managerial skills, and my creative strategies.
            </p>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-5">
              I'm the Director of Developer Relations at Cloudinary and I've worked as Head of Academic Advocacy at
               AWS, as a Principal Cloud
              Developer Advocate at Microsoft, and as a Developer Advocate at
              Progress/Telerik. I've also worked at small, medium, and large
              companies over my career and have founded an educational nonprofit.
